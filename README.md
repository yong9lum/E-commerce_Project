# E-commerce_Project

A hypothetical e-commerce company 'X' serves as a third-party retailer, bridging online shoppers with sellers. It also has its own production line of goods, & has a physical brick & mortar store in Singapore selling some of their own products. It is vital for 'X' to be ahead of customersâ€™ buying patterns & current trends, due to strong competition from other e-commerce companies with similarly competitive pricing & strong marketing.

The first part of this project uses data to recommend a loyalty program, to tier customers so that they can be rewarded gradually for spending more. Next, a forecasting model will be created so that the supply chain department can better manage the available inventory space & ensure that a future increase/decrease in demand can be accounted for. Lastly, a command line user interface will be programmed to allow easy summary pull outs of past data & generate future demands, serving as a user interface that all employees can access.
